# Webcam controller

This is a simple controller that allows starting the fswebcam with different parameters based on time of the day, relative to sunrise/sunset. It has been developed to work with cameras like ELP, which sometimes work better with autoexposure and sometimes with manual exposure, depending on circumstances.
